# Problem-Solving-Journey
This repository documents my ongoing journey through algorithmic and mathematical problem-solving. Here, I will:

* Revisit and analyze every LeetCode and Project Euler question I have solved.
* Explain my detailed thought process for each solution, from initial understanding to final implementation.
* Examine the time and space complexity of the algorithms used, discussing potential optimizations.

The primary goal of this collection is to showcase my slow and steady improvement in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through LeetCode, and in mathematical problem-solving through Project Euler. It serves as a personal log of growth and a resource for understanding various problem-solving techniques.
