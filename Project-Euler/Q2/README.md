## Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...**

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of even-valued terms.

## Thought Process

First we will try to find the entire sequence of Fibonacci sequence
After Finding the sequence we will find the even values within the sequence and sum the list

### Method 1

Just following my thought process 

```python
#Method 1
sequence = [1,2]
even_sequence = []
x = 0

while x < 4000000: # This sets hard limit
    x = sequence[len(sequence)-1] + sequence[len(sequence)-2]
    sequence.append(x)

for i in sequence:
    if i%2 == 0:
        even_sequence.append(i)

print(sum(even_sequence))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(N)
- Space Complexity is O(N)

### Method 2

We can write it in more consise way

```python
#Method 2
sequence = [1,2]
even_sequence = [2] #We have to add this beforehand otherwise 2 will not be included
x = 0

while x < 4000000:
    x = sequence[len(sequence)-1] + sequence[len(sequence)-2]
    sequence.append(x)
    
    if x %2 ==0:
        even_sequence.append(x)

print(sum(even_sequence))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(N)
- Space Complexity is O(N)
