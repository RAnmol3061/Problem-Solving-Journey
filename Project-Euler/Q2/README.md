## Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,...**

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of even-valued terms.

## Thought Process

First we will try to find the entire sequence of Fibonacci sequence
After Finding the sequence we will find the even values within the sequence and sum the list

### Method 1

Just following my thought process 

```python
#Method 1
sequence = [1,2]
even_sequence = []
x = 0

while x < 4000000: # This sets hard limit
    x = sequence[len(sequence)-1] + sequence[len(sequence)-2]
    sequence.append(x)

for i in sequence:
    if i%2 == 0:
        even_sequence.append(i)

print(sum(even_sequence))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(N)
- Space Complexity is O(N)

### Method 2

We can write it in more concise way and slightly more efficient.
Why slightly more efficient - It avoids a second loop over the entire sequence

```python
#Method 2
sequence = [1,2]
even_sequence = [2] #We have to add this beforehand otherwise 2 will not be included
x = 0

while x < 4000000:
    x = sequence[len(sequence)-1] + sequence[len(sequence)-2]
    sequence.append(x)
    
    if x %2 ==0:
        even_sequence.append(x)

print(sum(even_sequence))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(N)
- Space Complexity is O(N)

### Method 3

Main difference between Method 2 and Method 3 is that Method 3 is more space efficient because I am not storing sequence values in list.

```python
#Method 3
a,b = 1,2
next_fib = 0 
even_sum = 2 # We have hardcoded 2 because it is not taken into account inside the while loop

while True:
    next_fib = a + b
    if next_fib % 2 ==0:
        even_sum += next_fib

    if next_fib > 4000000:
        break
    a = b
    b = next_fib

print(even_sum)
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(N)
- Space Complexity is O(1). As we are only using few variables

### Method 4

We can solve this problem using Fibonacci property, which I also did not know before solving this question.

The **Mathematical Property** is: "**If $F_n$ is a Fibonacci number, then $F_n$ is even if and only if $n$ is a multiple of 3.**"

Which essentially means that every 3rd Fibonacci Number is even, so we don't have to calculate entire sequence and then find even numbers, we can directly find all the even number and sum it.

The formula we are going use is **$E_k = 4*E_k-1 + E_k-2$**

```python
#Method 4
e_k_minus_1 = 8
e_k_minus_2 = 2
even_sum = 10

while True:
    e_k = 4*e_k_minus_1 + e_k_minus_2
    if e_k > 4000000:
        break
    even_sum += e_k
    e_k_minus_2 = e_k_minus_1
    e_k_minus_1 = e_k
print(even_sum)
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity is O(log N). We are only counting even Fibonacci Number
- Space Complexity is O(1)
